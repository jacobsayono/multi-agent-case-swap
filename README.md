# Multi-Agent Case Swap

## Preliminary test scripts are saved in this repository.
`one_swap()` searches through all possible one-swaps between two robots and returns the best one.

`k_swap()` uses one-swap recursively to test all k-number of swaps.

`heuristic.cpp` uses euclidean properties to find potential tasks that can be swap. (TODO)
